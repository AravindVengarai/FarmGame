Welcome to FarmSim

FarmSim is a game similar in implementation to Farmville. There are two main entities: a farm where users can plant seeds to grow crops, and a market, where the farmer can sell crops, buy seeds, and other necessary items for plant growth like fertilizers etc. This game has also implemented random negative events that could harm the functioning of the farm like locust attacks and sudden drought. 

Here is a link to a demo the game.
